****Here, I deployed a Node JS application on the AWS EC2 Instance. ****

**Prerequisites**
1. I have cloned the entire project from the git-hub first.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/verma-kunal/AWS-Session.git
    ```
2. Downloaded and installed NodeJs package.
   ```
   https://nodejs.org/en/
   ```
4. I have tested the application on my local machine to see if it's running. 
   ```
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
